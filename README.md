Main code repository for Team Project 3 of Honours program.

## Project

[Open Transport Initiative](https://opentransport.co.uk/)

There are two components to our project:

* Implementing the Customer-Account API Specification, providing a proof of concept to demonstrate the interaction between two customer accounts.  We are creating mock accounts to act as endpoints and illustrate how the API facilitates communication of customer data between them.

* Implementing the Centralised Operator-Info API, providing  a lookup service which makes use of the PAS 212 standard in order to retrieve the details of different transport operators and MaaS platforms.  We are creating a simple endpoint to act as a query tool, where transport operators have the opportunity to fetch company data from the centralised database.

## Built With


* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
